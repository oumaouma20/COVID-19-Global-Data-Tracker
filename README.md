📊 Key Insights & Reflections
United States had the highest death rate, indicating possible healthcare pressure or reporting gaps.

India showed a sharp spike in total cases in mid-2021, possibly linked to new variants.

Vaccination trends appear to correlate with slowing case growth in some countries.

Some anomalies (e.g., sudden spikes) hint at delayed reporting or mass testing efforts.
